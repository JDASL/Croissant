        A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent
        shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
        of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
        dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The
        dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
        succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry.
